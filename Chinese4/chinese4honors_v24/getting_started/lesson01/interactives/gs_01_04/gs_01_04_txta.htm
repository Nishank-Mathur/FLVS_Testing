		<h3>Menu</h3>
		<p>Using the menu on the left allows you to navigate between <span class="lang"
				data-term="module_name">module</span>s.</p>

		<h3>Objectives</h3>
		<p>Why? Why do I have to learn this? The objectives are the "why" behind the "what." You can find all the
			objectives on this tab to help you direct your learning and studying. They even update with each page, so
			you can be sure exactly what the goal is for each <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>.
		</p>

		<h3>Glossary</h3>
		<p>Stop! Don’t google it, and don’t translate it! You can find it here. The glossary has most of the words in
			the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s. You can search from English to Chinese or
			Chinese to English. </p>

		<h3>Toolbox</h3>
		<p>Use the Toolbox to access a searchable page where you can find the supporting documents for any <span
				class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s in this course. </p>

		<h3>Speech Tools</h3>
		<p>To master a language, you should speak it. You will have many opportunities to practice your Chinese. If you
			are unable to access the speech tool, you can find other options here to complete the recordings. Don’t
			hesitate to reach out to your teacher if you have a concern. </p>

		<h3>Print</h3>

		<h3><span class="lang" data-term="module_name:uc">Module</span> Progress Bar </h3>
		<p>Using the <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> progress bar will help you see how much of
			the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> you have completed already. You can also
			navigate to other pages within the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> from the <span
				class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> progress bar.</p>

		<h3>Home and Arrows</h3>
		<p>Using the Home icon will be the fastest route back to the course home page. The left arrow navigates to the
			previous page, and the right arrow navigates to the next page.</p>
