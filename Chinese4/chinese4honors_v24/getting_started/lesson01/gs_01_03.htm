    <!-- <h2>Lessons & Assessments: Submitting Your Work</h2> -->
    <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
    <p>As you complete each <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will need to submit an
      assessment. Assessments consist of pretests, quizzes, voice activities, <span class="lang"
        data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>s<span class="unlock default altdisplay dba-off">, Discussion-Based
        Assessments</span>, and exams.</p>

    <h3>Pretest</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of each <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will take a pretest of
      multiple-choice questions related to the content in the <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>
      to see what you already know. Don't worry; this diagnostic will have little to no impact on your grade, but it
      will give you a window into the knowledge you will gain throughout the <span class="lang"
        data-term="module_name">module</span>. It will also help you understand one component of how you will be
      assessed in the course.</p>

    <h3>Quizzes</h3>
    <p>Many <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s include a multiple-choice quiz with questions. In
      these types of assessments, you will choose one correct answer from the choices given. Often the question is
      paired with an image or data graph. To be successful, make sure to read each question and its stimuli carefully
      and use your skills to select the best response.</p>

    <h3><span class="lang" data-term="module_name:uc">Module</span> Exams</h3>
    <p>Modules 1, 2, and 4 will end with a multiple-choice and matching exam that assesses your understanding. </p>

    <h3>Voice Activities</h3>
    <p>Lesson 3 for all m<span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>s will have a voice activity that you
      will need to complete. For this <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>, you will need to
      record and submit an audio in complete sentences in Chinese. </p>


    <h3>Presentational Speaking</h3>
    <p>Lesson 8 for all <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>s will be a presentational speaking
      activity that you will need to complete. For this <span class="lang"
        data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>, you will need to record and submit an audio or a video, using
      complete sentences in Chinese.</p>


    <div class="unlock default altdisplay dba-off">
      <h3>Discussion-Based Assessments</h3>
      <p>The discussion-based assessment (or DBA) is an opportunity to discuss your skills and learning objectives in
        each <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> with your instructor. This isn't a "one size fits
        all" activity. Each DBA is a specific activity and discussion. It provides opportunities for you to make
        connections in your own learning across key concepts, ideas, and policies. You can ask questions and demonstrate
        your growing skills in Chinese.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><span class="lang" data-term="segment_name:uc">Segment</span> Exam</h3>
    <p>The <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span> exam at the end of each <span class="lang"
        data-term="segment_name">segment</span> in the course will assess your understanding of the course as a whole.
      It will include multiple-choice and matching questions.</p>

    <div class="unlock default altdisplay collab-off">
      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <p>Collaboration assessments are peer project opportunities. You will have the opportunity to participate in a
        complex, multi-step, problem-solving activity and share feedback with at least one other student to benefit from
        a peer's perspective. There are synchronous and asynchronous opportunities, meaning you do not have to be
        working with your peers at the exact same time, but you may. However, you must complete the collaboration
        assessment before taking the <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span> exam. There are
        opportunities provided in the collaboration section. Contact your instructor early about collaboration
        opportunities. </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Workshops</h3>
    <p>The workshops will give you an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of Chinese 4 through a host of
      interesting and creative activities such as creating a menu in Chinese. In each workshop you will also have the
      opportunity to learn and practice handwriting twenty Chinese characters and use them in your work. These workshop
      activities will be submitted to your instructor and graded according to a rubric.</p>

    <h3>Rubrics</h3>
    <p> Certain <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>s contain a rubric that your teacher
      will use to grade your <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>. The rubric shows you
      exactly the kind of work your teacher will expect from you. <em>Before beginning your <span class="lang"
          data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span></em>, read through
      the
      rubric to understand the expectations of the <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>. Use
      it to guide you as you complete your <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>. Then,
      before you submit your work, compare it against the rubric to make sure you’re turning in the best work possible.
