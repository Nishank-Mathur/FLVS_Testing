    <h1>STOP AND COLLABORATE</h1>
    <p>Art can be found everywhere. For this collaboration, you will have the opportunity to research and discuss two
      forms of art from the Chinese culture.</p>
    <p>This collaboration has three parts:</p>
    <div class="tabs" data-position="left"> <a class="tab"
        title="Answer the following questions and record your answers">Answer the following questions
        and record your answers</a>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Select two forms of art from the Chinese culture.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research and review two forms of art from the Chinese culture.</li>
          <li>Write down at least four important details about the two forms of art and explain briefly four important
            details or pieces of information about the two forms of art you selected. </li>
          <li>Write down additional information (at least four examples) about the two forms of art you selected: Where
            did each form of art originate? What positive impact does each form of art have? Are there other forms of
            art similar to the ones you selected? What is your viewpoint about each form of art?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>* Remember, you will conduct brief, online research before starting this collaboration. </p>
        <p><strong>Include the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Give three sentences in <strong>Chinese</strong>, introducing yourself. Include (in complete sentences)
            your name, where you live, and how old you are. </li>
          <li>Prepare one paragraph of at least four to five sentences in <strong>English</strong>, describing the
            important details and
            additional important information about the two forms of art you selected.
          </li>
          <li>Create a seven-question survey of questions to ask your partner. The first three questions should be in
            <strong>Chinese</strong>, asking your partner their name, where they live, and how old they are. The
            remaining four questions
            should be in <strong>English</strong>, asking your partner about which two forms of art from the Chinese
            culture they chose,
            the important details they discovered, and any additional information about the two forms of art they
            selected.
