    <h1>STOP AND COLLABORATE</h1>
    <p>Every community has contributions in our world. For this collaboration, you will have the opportunity to research
      and discuss one contribution from the Chinese culture in your country or in the world and how that contribution
      improves society (jobs, language, etc.).</p>

    <p>This collaboration has three parts:</p>
    <div class="tabs" data-position="left"> <a class="tab"
        title="Answer the following questions and record your answers">Answer the following questions
        and record your answers</a>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Select one contribution from the Chinese culture in your country or in the world.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research and review one contribution from the Chinese culture in your country or in the world and how that
            contribution improves society (jobs, language, etc.). </li>
          <li>Write down at least four important details about the contribution and explain briefly four important
            details or information about the contribution you selected. </li>
          <li>Write down additional information (at least four examples) about the contribution you selected: How did it
            arrive to your country or place(s) in the world? What positive impact does the contribution have? Is this
            similar to another contribution in your country or place(s) in the world, or is it different from another
            contribution in your country or place(s) in the world? </li>
        </ul>
        <p>* Remember, you will conduct brief, online research before starting this collaboration. </p>
        <p><strong>Include the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Give three sentences in <strong>Chinese</strong>, introducing yourself. Include (in complete sentences)
            your name, where
            you live, and how old you are. </li>
          <li>Prepare one paragraph of at least four to five sentences in <strong>English</strong>, describing the
            important details
            and additional important information about the contribution you selected. </li>
          <li>Create a seven-question survey of questions to ask your partner. The first three questions should be in
            <strong>Chinese</strong>, asking your partner their name, where they live, and how old they are. The
            remaining four questions
            should be in <strong>English</strong>, asking your partner about which Chinese contribution they chose, the
            important details
            they discovered, and any additional information about the contribution they selected.
