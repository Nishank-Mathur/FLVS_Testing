		<h1>Collaboration: What You Need to Know</h1>

		<p>Working with others is an important skill to develop and one you will use often in your future education and career paths. In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will explore the types of collaboration opportunities available and guidelines for completion. Get ready to work together!</p>

		<h2>But How?</h2>

		<p>Collaboration can be completed synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous collaboration is live—all participants are working on the project at the same time. This may be accomplished on the phone, in a live <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> with your teacher, face-to-face, or via another method of real-time collaboration. To collaborate asynchronously, participants each complete a part of the project independently. This may include adding to what your partner has already done. For asynchronous collaboration, all participants do not necessarily have to be available at the same time. Select the images to learn more about each type of collaboration.</p>
